My personal dotfiles, with configurations for other apps under `app-settings` and `install` carrying scripts to install essential applications/tools for a new machine. All of my Atom editor settings, including my custom snippets are synced using [sync-settings][sync-settings-repo] and are stored on [this gist][my-atom-settings].

If this piqued your interests, I encourage you to read [my post][my-post] on setting up a new macOS dev machine as well as [Github's page on dotfiles][gh-dotfiles].
